# Margarida Cardeano Pinheiro - Bioinformatics Scientist

## Welcome

I'm a bioinformatics scientist with a strong foundation in genomic data analysis, computational biology, and data science. Starting my career while still studying, I ventured into content management, quickly adapting to a field outside my main area of study. This early experience reflects my ability to learn rapidly, embrace new challenges, and succeed across diverse domains.

I specialize in analyzing complex biological datasets, designing bioinformatics workflows, and developing custom scripts for genomic data analysis. My programming expertise spans Python, R, SQL, Bash, and C, along with strong skills in Excel and Power BI for data visualization and business analytics. With expertise in Python, I’ve developed skills for data processing, primer validation, and database structuring. Alongside my scientific background, I also have experience in content creation and digital marketing, enabling me to strategize, produce, and optimize campaigns that bridge technical content with broader audience engagement.

Through hands-on research in genomics and health informatics, I’ve contributed to advancements in predictive modeling, genome analysis, and data-driven insights for both scientific and commercial applications. My adaptability and commitment to continuous learning make me a valuable asset across diverse fields.
