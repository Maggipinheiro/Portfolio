# Margarida Cardeano Pinheiro - Bioinformatics Scientist

## Welcome

I'm a bioinformatics scientist with a strong foundation in genomic data analysis, computational biology, and data science. Starting my career while still studying, I ventured into content management, quickly adapting to a field outside my main area of study. This early experience reflects my ability to learn rapidly, embrace new challenges, and succeed across diverse domains.

I specialize in analyzing complex biological datasets, designing bioinformatics workflows, and developing custom scripts for genomic data analysis. My programming expertise spans Python, R, SQL, Bash, and C, along with strong skills in Excel and Power BI for data visualization and business analytics. With expertise in Python, I’ve developed skills for data processing, primer validation, and database structuring. Alongside my scientific background, I also have experience in content creation and digital marketing, enabling me to strategize, produce, and optimize campaigns that bridge technical content with broader audience engagement.

Through hands-on research in genomics and health informatics, I’ve contributed to advancements in predictive modeling, genome analysis, and data-driven insights for both scientific and commercial applications. My adaptability and commitment to continuous learning make me a valuable asset across diverse fields.

## Key Projects

### 1. [DIB Pipeline: Drosophila Inversion Breakpoints Analysis](https://github.com/JoaoTomasMotaCunha/My_Portfolio/tree/main/drosophila-inversion-breakpoints)
- **Role**: MSc Student in Phenotypic Evolution Research Group
- **Skills**: Bash, Docker, Git, Linux System Administration, Data Analytics
- **Overview**: Developed a comprehensive bioinformatics workflow using Bash and Docker to analyze genomic inversion breakpoints in _Drosophila_ genomes. The pipeline processed raw genomic data, conducted breakpoint validation using BLASTn, and contributed to understanding genetic variation in fruit flies.
- **Impact**: Streamlined analysis for researchers working on evolutionary genomics, providing a robust and adaptable tool for specific genetic studies.

### 2. [Peach Tree Orchard Health Prediction](https://github.com/JoaoTomasMotaCunha/My_Portfolio/tree/main/peach-tree-orchard-prediction)
- **Role**: Research Assistant (UBI)
- **Skills**: Python, Convolutional Neural Networks, Data Analytics, Image Processing
- **Overview**: Processed multispectral images captured by drones to predict the health and vigor of peach trees using Python and CNNs. Calculated vegetation indices like NDVI and employed the Faster R-CNN model for accurate canopy segmentation.
- **Impact**: Demonstrated the effectiveness of AI in agriculture, helping farmers optimize resource use and improve orchard management.

### 3. [Personalized Prediction of Hypoglycemia Events](https://github.com/JoaoTomasMotaCunha/My_Portfolio/tree/main/hypoglycemia-prediction)
- **Role**: Research Assistant (UBI)
- **Skills**: Python, Machine Learning, Healthcare Informatics, Model Development
- **Overview**: Developed a personalized machine learning model to predict hypoglycemia events in diabetic patients. Implemented algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Neural Networks using patient data (glucose levels, diet, insulin dosage, etc.).
- **Impact**: Provided a tool for healthcare professionals to intervene early and offer personalized patient care, advancing predictive analytics in diabetes management.
